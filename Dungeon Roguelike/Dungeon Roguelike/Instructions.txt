Controls:
W = Up     A = Left
S = Down   D = Right   E = Dig

You are trapped in a dungeon and the only exit is 
blocked by a boulder that can only be moved if you
eat enough energy bars.

Lucky for you there are plenty of energy bars
scattered around the dungeon left by previous 
explorers.

Unfortunately there are ancient evil mummies
wandering randomly around the dungeon and if you
touch the enemy you lose a life.

The only defence you have against the mummies are
spades that can be found in the dungeon. A spade 
allows you to dig a hole that traps any mummy that 
falls in, however you will lose a life you fall in!

You can leave the dungeon once enough energy bars 
are collected, the boulder is moved and the exit is
reached before you run out of lives.
